      <h2>The Bride & Groom</h2>
      <img src="images/ben_and_siobhan.jpg" class="photo right" />
      <p>If you don’t know at least one of these two people, you’re probably at the wrong wedding. Having first met at secondary school they were reunited at a school reunion that Siobhan organised (most out of character!) and the rest is history. <strong><em>Specialist skills:</em></strong> making people feel nauseated through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJOoW9nLI8A" target="_blank">power of song</a>.</p>
      
      <h2>The Best Men</h2>
      <img src="images/jack_and_sian.jpg" class="photo left" />
      <p><strong>Jack – The Male One</strong><br />Jack and Siobhan have known each other since they were four years old, and many years later both migrated to Newcastle. One of the envious brothers to Ben’s Joseph (and Siobhan’s chorus girl) in the school production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat, we only hope Jack doesn’t throw Ben in a pit and steal his clothes... <strong><em>Specialist skills:</em></strong> political savant; decorator of shoes.</p>
      <p><strong>Siân – The Not Male One</strong> (or, as she prefers, “Best Man Woman Man”)<br />Siân met Ben when they lived next door to each other in Birmingham whilst at university. Siân quickly claimed Ben as an "adopted brother". She moved to Gateshead (the dodgy side of the river) not long after Ben moved to Newcastle, just in time to become the required fourth player in the Battlestar Galactica boardgame. <strong><em>Specialist skills:</em></strong> open-water swimming; setting tables (she promises).</p>
      
      <h2>The Bridesmaids</h2>
      <img src="images/jenni.jpg" class="photo right" />
      <p><strong>Jenni</strong><br />Jenni and Siobhan met on their doctorate course and later lived together, forming what some call the best roommate coupling since Bert and Ernie.  The Father of the Bride was once convinced Siobhan and Jenni should marry, so might still be mourning the loss of his would-be daughter-in-law.  Having persuaded Siobhan to run a 10k assault course with 24 hours’ notice, Jenni clearly has magical powers of persuasion, so watch out! <strong><em>Specialist skills:</em></strong> getting locked in bathrooms; swapping dance partners mid-dance; speediest washer-upper in the North East 2012.</p>
      
      <img src="images/elly.jpg" class="photo left" />
      <p><strong>Elly</strong><br />Elly and Siobhan first bonded on a three-hour train journey discussing their shared love of Harry Potter.  They spent an inordinate amount of time planning Siobhan’s wedding long before there was a sniff of a groom.  Elly was responsible for putting Siobhan on My Single Friend, which luckily for Ben didn't work out! <strong><em>Specialist skills:</em></strong> cheerleading; being the Elphaba to Siobhan’s Glinda.</p>
      
      <img src="images/amy.jpg" class="photo right" />
      <p><strong>Amy</strong><br />During the final year of her doctorate Siobhan decided to reclaim her social life and joined a choir (yes, she is that rock and roll).  She was roped into being a soprano for the numbers despite clearly lacking the range, and thus met Amy and formed a solid friendship based on gossiping while the choir leader teaches the other parts, and giggling at lyrical innuendos.  Karaoke partner in crime and the better half of our future ABBA tribute act. <strong><em>Specialist skills:</em></strong> actually singing soprano; doing the speaking bits in Taylor Swift songs.</p>
      
      <img src="images/marianne.jpg" class="photo left" />
      <p><strong>Marianne</strong><br />Siobhan’s friend since day one of their undergraduate degree, Marianne is often baffled by Siobhan’s interests but supportive throughout.  Siobhan and Marianne have now gone to see Derren Brown together three times and there’s a risk that one of them is permanently hypnotised as a result.  The only Geordie Ben has ever been able to understand, Marianne could endlessly entertain him by repeatedly saying “oompa loompa”.  <strong><em>Specialist skills:</em></strong> making homemade toiletries and alcoholic beverages; ensuring Siobhan has presents to open every Christmas!</p>
      
      <h2>The Ushers</h2>
      <img src="images/reuben_and_asher.jpg" class="photo right" />
      <p><strong>Reuben</strong> (left) and <strong>Asher</strong> (right) are Ben's little (yet taller) brothers and Ushers extraordinaire. Reuben will be the one sporting dreadlocks and arriving in his homemade campervan, while Asher just enjoys another opportunity to wear his "Usher" cufflinks and take up the rhyming title of "Asher the Usher". Reuben will be in charge of the campsite so be sure to give him your money on the day to secure a pitch for your tent. Asher will be herding people for photographs. <strong><em>Specialist skills:</em></strong> with Reuben's circus skills and Asher's magic tricks they're quite the entertaining duo.</p>
      
      <h2>Father of the Bride</h2>
      <img src="images/bob.jpg" class="photo left" />
      <p><strong>Bob a.k.a. Captain B.</strong><br />As well as ensuring Siobhan doesn’t fall over as they walk down the aisle, Bob will be delivering his hotly-anticipated Father of the Bride speech.  Famed for his anecdotes and for never rushing to get to the point, sweepstake participants would do well to assume his speech will take hours rather than minutes. <strong><em>Specialist skills:</em></strong> Chief Gamesmaster (a mass game of “This is a Tick, this is a Tock” may be on the cards).  Also known for his party piece performing “A Boy Named Sue” (10,000 hits on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToKs82RVyDY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>!).</p>
      
      <h2>Mother of the Bride</h2>
      <img src="images/helene.jpg" class="photo right" />
      <p><strong>Hélène</strong> has a memory like an elephant and remembers everyone ever, their uncle and their shoe size. If you don't know who someone is, chances are Hélène will. Responsible for Siobhan's tendency to catch herself singing in supermarkets and to automatically harmonise, if there's a sing-song, Hélène will be getting involved. Hélène will be signing the register along with Sarah. <strong><em>Specialist skills:</em></strong> Eliza Doolittle impression; hair plaiting; driving long cars at only 4'11" tall.</p>
      
      <h2>Stepmother of the Bride</h2>
      <img src="images/judy.jpg" class="photo left" />
      <p><strong>Judy</strong> is Bob's partner and number one fan of Bob and Siobhan's comedic talents. Patience of a saint and cookery skills of Delia Smith. Likely to be found liberating the piglets or critiquing Bob's speech with Hélène. <strong><em>Specialist skills:</em></strong> mediating in Scattergories disputes; Barry Manilow trivia; horse-whispering.</p>
      
      <h2>Mother & Father of the Groom</h2>
      <img src="images/sarah_and_nigel.jpg" class="photo right" />
      <p>Although you might expect the father of Benjamin, Reuben and Asher to be called Jacob, he's actually <strong>Nigel</strong>, and he has just the one wife, <strong>Sarah</strong>, mother to all three! Sarah will be signing the register with Hélène, and Nigel will be sitting quietly and smugly in the knowledge that having had three sons means he never has to make a speech.  With catch phrases like "you could make one of those" and "just fill it and sand it", Nigel can solve any DIY problem with a tube of No More Nails, while Sarah makes it pretty again with her talent for painting. <strong><em>Specialist skills</em></strong>: "looking after" the wine supplies; garden landscaping.</p>
      
      <h2>The Reader</h2>
      <img src="images/tom.jpg" class="photo left" />
      <p><strong>Tom</strong> and Siobhan have been close friends since secondary school when the gang used to gather at Tom’s house for cultured nights of book reading / cribbage / definitely not underage drinking.  Living with Jack in Newcastle for a number of years, Tom was arguably the hairiest of the Three Amigos.  Between them, Tom and Jack kept Siobhan relatively sane during the dark days of the doctorate. <strong><em>Specialist skills</strong></em>: looking like Kevin Keegan; Ladyboy and Shmemly drinking.</p>
      
      <h2 id="special-mentions">Special Mentions</h2>
      <p><strong>Jenny</strong><br />Cake maker extraordinaire, Jenny has a knack for combining the bride and groom’s individual favourite things into one cake – hello Chocolate and Guinness cake!  Jenny nourishes our minds and bodies with her fab cooking, caring nature and wicked sense of humour. <strong><em>Specialist skills</em></strong>: cake-making; doing the Thriller dance.</p>
      <p><strong>Sophie</strong><br />Tom’s lovely lady-wife, Soph should be easy to spot as she’ll be surrounded by people cooing over her newborn baby.  Bridesmaid in honour if not in dress (due to aforementioned cute newborn) Soph was encouraging of this union from the start, even seeking feedback attesting to Ben’s title as the Best Kisser at Bourne Grammar School (that’s true friendship). <strong><em>Specialist skills</em></strong>: making cute kids; singing with a fist of pure emotion.</p>
      <p><strong>Lucy</strong><br />Probably the person who knows the most about the finer details of our wedding, Lucy has created something very special for our table plan.  <strong><em>Specialist skills</em></strong>: see the table plan!</p>
      <p><strong>James Rouse</strong><br />James is our photographer - he will go to great lengths for a good photo, so don't be surprised if you see him half way up a tree or wading in the pond. If you're from the Walsh (i.e. vertically-challenged) side of Siobhan's family, please don't be offended if he tries to use you as a tripod.   <strong><em>Specialist skills</em></strong>: photography (we hope!); stealth and invisibility.</p>
