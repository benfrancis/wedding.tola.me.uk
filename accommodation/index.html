      <h2>Camping</h2>
      <p>For the outdoor types and cost conscious it is possible to camp at the wedding venue (night of the wedding only)
      for just £5 per person (or £12.50 with a bacon butty and cup of tea brought to your tent in the morning). Campers should use the main toilet block at the left hand end of the courtyard walkway.
      They may also use the shower, disabled and baby change facilities to wash and change which is situated at the
      far end of the Granary.</p>
      
      <p>Tents, camper vans, motor homes and caravans are all welcome but please be
      aware there are no electric hook up facilities, and camp fires, BBQs and camping stoves are not allowed.
      Payment is due before the ceremony/drinks reception, Reuben Francis will be collecting payments on the day.</p>
      <p>There is also a limited number of traditional Romany caravans available to stay in from £80 per night including breakfast.</p>
      <p>You can find out more information about camping and caravans at South Farm <a href="http://www.south-farm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Accommodation.pdf">here</a>,
      but please be aware that <strong>all bookings are made through the bride and groom</strong>. Please contact Ben at <a href="mailto:ben@tola.me.uk">ben@tola.me.uk</a> if you are interested.

      <h2>Cambridge Belfry Hotel</h2>
      <img id="belfry" src="images/belfry.png" class="photo" alt="The Cambridge Belfry" />
      <p>We have an allocation of rooms at the nearby <a href="http://www.qhotels.co.uk/our-locations/the-cambridge-belfry/">Cambridge Belfry Hotel</a> and can organise group travel between the hotel
      and South Farm on the day (see below).</p>
      <p>The hotel is about 11 miles/20 minutes north of the venue and has 120 rooms and a restaurant. Car parking is
      available, late check in can be arranged and late return is not a problem.</p>
      <p>Nightly fixed rates for Sunday including breakfast are:</p>
      <ul id="prices">
        <li>£100 double</li>
        <li>£90 single occupancy</li>
        <li>(Various upgrades available from £10 per room)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We recommend booking as soon as possible because we only have a limited allocation and any allocated rooms not booked by 31st July will be released for general sale. After 31st July, if the hotel has vacancies, you will still be able to book through normal procedures and at prevailing rates.  Bookings made after 31st July will not, however, be able to use the transport described below.</p>
      <p>To book the hotel, please call (<a href="tel://01954714600">01954 714600</a>) or email <a href="mailto:cambridgebelfryreservations@qhotels.co.uk">cambridgebelfryreservations@qhotels.co.uk</a> quoting the reference 'Currell & Francis External Wedding'.</p>
      
      <h2>Transport</h2>
      <p><strong>Taxis</strong><br />There's plenty of parking at the venue, but if you need a taxi then we advise booking them well in advance as they are rarely available if booked at the end of the night. For travel in the Royston direction try Butlers Meltax on <a href="tel://01763244444">01763 244444</a> or in the Cambridge direction Cam Cabs on <a href="tel://01223704704">01223 704704</a>.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Group Transportation</strong><br />We are able to organise group transport by coach between the Cambridge Belfry Hotel and South Farm for day and evening guests.</p>
      <p>We expect the cost will be £7.50 per person for the return trip.  However, if there is insufficient demand to make a coach viable, we may have to look at other options. For this reason, we must have requests in by <strong>31st July</strong>. For logistical reasons we cannot extend this offer to guests who do not stay at The Belfry. The times would be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1.00pm</strong> Day guests (from The Belfry to South Farm for 2.00pm ceremony)	
        <li><strong>7.00pm</strong> Evening guests (from The Belfry to South Farm for 7.30pm)</li>
        <li><strong>11.10pm</strong> First return departure from South Farm to The Belfry	(event ends 0.00am)*</li>
        <li><strong>0.10am</strong> Second return departure from South Farm to The Belfry*</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>To book group transport:</strong> As soon as you have booked your accommodation at The Belfry you will need to request transport by sending an email to <a href="mailto:bob@currell.org.uk">bob@currell.org.uk</a> or by calling Bob on <a href="tel://01733240678">01733 240678</a>.</p>
      <p>Please enter in the subject line of your email 'Belfry Transport'  and < - your name> e.g. Belfry Transport - Jim Smith.</p>
      <p>In the body please include the following:</p>
